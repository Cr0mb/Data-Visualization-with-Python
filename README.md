# Data-Visualization-with-Python
We're gonna dive into creating a tutorial on data visualization using Python libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. 
We'll cover the basics of creating different types of plots such as line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots, and then explore how to customize them to 
make our data analysis more insightful and visually appealing.

First, make sure you have Matplotlib and Seaborn installed. If not, you can install them using pip:
```
pip install matplotlib seaborn
```

Second, download the github repository and run the scripts.
```
git clone https://github.com/Cr0mb/Data-Visualization-with-Python.git
```

Third, go into the repositories downlaoded directory.
```
cd Data-Visualization-With-Python
```

Fourth, run, and see the magic of coding!
```
python (filename).py
```
